Creating Algorithm For Q4

Rows i Total = 9
Columns j Total = 5

Top half of the pattern
i = 1 , j = 5
i = 2 , j = 4,5
i = 3 , j = 3,4,5
i = 4 , j = 2,3,4,5
i = 5 , j = 1,2,3,4,5

Bottom half of the pattern
i = 6 , j = 1,2,3,4
i = 7 , j = 1,2,3
i = 8 , j = 1,2
i = 9 , j = 1

j are the one on which * is printed depending on the values of i

For the top half we can see when i is 1 print spaces till 4, meaning that max_col(5) - i (1 to 4 don't print space on 5th), else print "*" 
now we can make an if condition if(j>5-i) print space else print *
We are done with Top Half :)


For the bottom half we can see print * from 1 to 4 when i == 6 and so on, we know total rows = i = 9 (so we have to create a condtion for this now)
print * until (9-i)+1, for example when i == 6, (9-6)+1 is equal to (3 + 1 = 4) and when i =7 (9-7)+1 = 3 and so on until i reaches 9 (9-9)+1 = 1
Now We are done with Bottom Half Too :)
